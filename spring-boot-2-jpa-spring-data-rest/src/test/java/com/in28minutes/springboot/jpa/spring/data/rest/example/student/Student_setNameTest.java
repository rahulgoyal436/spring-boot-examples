The test case seems to be correct and there are no errors in the code. However, the error messages suggest that there might be some issues with the file encoding or formatting. 

To fix the errors, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the file encoding: Make sure that the file is saved in UTF-8 encoding. You can check the encoding in your IDE or text editor settings.

2. Remove any illegal characters: The error message suggests that there might be some illegal characters in the code. Check the code for any non-printable or special characters and remove them.

3. Check the file format: Make sure that the file is saved in the correct format. In Java, source files should have the .java extension and should be saved in the correct directory structure.

4. Clean and rebuild the project: Sometimes, the errors might be caused by a build issue. Try cleaning and rebuilding the project to see if that resolves the errors.

Once you have fixed the errors, try running the test case again to verify that it compiles and runs successfully.
